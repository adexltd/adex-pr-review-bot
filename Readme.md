Sure, here's a simple README file for running smee.io from the command line interface:

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) - You can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. Open your terminal.

2. Install the packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. After installing smee-client, you can start using it by running the following command in your terminal:

   ````bash
   smee --url https://smee.io/your-unique-url --path /webhook --port 3000
   ```l.

   ````

2. Once the smee.io channel is running, it will forward webhook payloads from the specified URL to your local development server.

3. You can now use this URL to receive webhook payloads during development or testing.

## Example

```bash
smee --url https://smee.io/your-unique-url --target http://localhost:8000
```

This command will start forwarding webhook payloads from the smee.io channel to a local server running on port 8000.
